            <article>
                <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Python?</h3>
                <p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
                    Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
                    programming languages.
                    Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
                    This means that prototyping can be very quick.
                    Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>
                <h3>Good to know</h3>
                <p>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
                    However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still
                    quite popular.
                    In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                    Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are
                    particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</p>
                <h5>It is used for:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>web development (server-side)</li>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by
                Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for
                emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of
                code.

                In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started.
                Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum
                Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby
                project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The
                programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had
                interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already
                helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the
                features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its
                good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created
                a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s
                TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short,
                unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the
                “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July
                2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.
                The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express
                the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main
                objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it
                had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception
                handling and functions.</p>
            <h3>Version's</h3>
            <p>Python Software Foundation (PSF) used to support two major versions, Python 2.x & Python 3.x. PSF
                supported Python 2 because a large body of existing code could not be forward ported to Python 3. So,
                they supported Python 2 until January 2020, but now they have stopped supporting it. Python 3.0 was
                released on December 3rd, 2008. It was designed to rectify certain flaws in the earlier version. This
                version is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. However, many of its major
                features have since been back-ported to the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3
                include utilities to facilitate the automation of Python 2 code translation to Python 3.</p>

        <section id="helloworld">
            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>Hello, World! is often the first program that programmers learn to write when they start learning a new
                programming language. It’s a simple program that prints the phrase “Hello, World!” to the console or
                output
                window. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its readability and
                ease
                of use. Python is often used for scripting, web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.
                Write a simple hello world program in Python?
            </p>
            <code>print("Hello World")</code>

        <section id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.Variables do not need to be declared
                with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
            <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
                Rules for Python variables:
                A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
                A variable name cannot start with a number
                A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
                Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
                A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.</p>
            <h3>Global Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global
                variables.Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.If you create a
                variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside
                the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original
                value.</p>
